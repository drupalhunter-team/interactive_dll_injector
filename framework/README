This is the framework to coonect to the erlayer and deal with modules.

The way this thing is going to work is to open a socket to connet to
the erlayer and tell the erlayer its namespace. Within the namespace
is the modules that the framework loads. The modules are of course 
dll's that have the function declarations exported via the method that
I was using for the previous version of the dispatcher. This leaves a
very flexible method to do things with.
